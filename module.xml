	<description>
		Creates custom contexts which can be used to allow limited access to dialplan applications.
		Allows for time restrictions on any dialplan access.
		Allows for pattern matching to allow/deny.
		Allows for failover destinations, and PIN protected failover.
		This can be very useful for multi-tennant systems.
		Inbound routing can be done using DID or zap channel routing,	this module allows for selective outbound routing.
		House/public phones can be placed in a restricted context allowing them only internal calls.

								*0.3.4* see http://freepbx.org/forum/freepbx/users/custom-contexts-broken-in-freepbx-2-3-1-3
                *0.3.3* Added Set All option to quickly allow/deny all.
                        Fixed bug which caused routes to be denied after rename/sort/or delete other route.
                *0.3.2* Optional PIN to protect failover destination.
                        Contexts can now be used as destinations. An IVR menu, Time Condition, etc. can now send a caller into a custom context.
                        (This last feature requires a bugfix in 2.2 after rc1. bug #1549)
                *0.3.1* Now prompts on delete. After duplicate you are editing new context. Allows rename context.
                *0.3.0* New Features:
                        Allow or Deny based on pattern matching.
                        Failover Destination (one for regular extension, one for failed feature codes)
                        Bugfixes:
                        Adjusted Gui, Duplicate context, now duplicates the description too.
                *0.2.2* Bugfix: Duplicate Context now copies the priority also.
                *0.2.1* Added Duplicate Context option to easily copy an entire set of rules.
                *0.2.0* Added priority feature to allow the user to control in what order the allowed contexts are included.
                *0.1.3* Made it obvious when allowing one include may allow another entire context.
                *0.1.2* Bugfixes- deleted routes, etc. now are removed.
                        Context tests for spaces and illegal chars.
                        Moved admin to tools to reduce confusion.
                        Added option to allow entire internal dialplan. (Usefull for time limit on everything)
                        Made description for outbound-allroutes clearer that allowing overrides to allow all routes.
                *0.1.1* Still Beta, added time groups and bugfixes
                *0.0.1* Beta release

	<attention>
		This is an advanced module, and you should not use it without understanding asterisk dialplans!
		This is meant as a convenience tool for someone who would have had to resort to config editing.
		If you experience problems with it, just disable it and no harm done.
		REMEMBER! Any device placed in a restricted context will have no access to the dialplan if this module is disabled until it is placed in a normal context!
